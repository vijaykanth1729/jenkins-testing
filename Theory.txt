Jenkins:
--------
Developer------->Git(VCS)--->Jenkins--->Test, build,deploy, and run-->
Every operation we perform on Jenkins is called Job.


Jenkins will create an Image and push it to Registry (docker hub/ECR)
But jenkins has a credentails manager system, which requires you to set up
your credentails of third party tools.
1)Jenkins requires Java to be installed on ur system.
2)Go and download jenkins..
once you download it you get .war file..
then run the command like below
eg: jenkins -jar jenkins.war  (For running Jenkins..)
----------------
docker pull jenkins
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d  --name jenkins_master jenkins 



Automated deployements:
--------------------------
Build--->Deploy--->Test----->Release



developer---->VCS(GitHUb)------<Jenkins>----->Build_process---->Deploy(TestEnv, StableEnv)---->(Functional testing, regression testing)--->Release(Prod)
